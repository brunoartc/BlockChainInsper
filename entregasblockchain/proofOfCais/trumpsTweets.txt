Nov 19, 2017 06:22:17 PM Sen. Jeff Flake(y), who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite President. He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is “toast.” [Twitter for iPhone] 
Nov 19, 2017 06:36:40 PM Shoplifting is a very big deal in China, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful! [Twitter for iPhone]

Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think.. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Nov 22, 2017 05:33:28 AM ...LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool! [Twitter for iPhone]

Nov 23, 2017 06:18:00 PM ObamaCare premiums are going up, up, up, just as I have been predicting for two years. ObamaCare is OWNED by the Democrats, and it is a disaster. But do not worry. Even though the Dems want to Obstruct, we will Repeal & Replace right after Tax Cuts! [Twitter for iPhone]

Nov 24, 2017 07:04:13 AM Will be speaking to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey this morning about bringing peace to the mess that I inherited in the Middle East.

Nov 24, 2017 07:10:46 AM After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson. Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA! [Twitter for iPhone]

Nov 24, 2017 01:49:12 PM Will be calling the President of Egypt in a short while to discuss the tragic terrorist attack, with so much loss of life. We have to get TOUGHER AND SMARTER than ever before, and we will. Need the WALL, need the BAN! God bless the people of Egypt. [Twitter for iPhone]

Nov 25, 2017 04:48:16 PM The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life! [Twitter for iPhone]

Nov 25, 2017 05:37:21 PM .@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them! [Twitter for iPhone]

Nov 26, 2017 08:52:36 AM The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Nov 26, 2017 09:33:47 AM I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn’t enough. Can’t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Nov 26, 2017 04:29:46 PM Since the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia. Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Nov 26, 2017 08:47:32 PM Back in D.C., big week for Tax Cuts and many other things of great importance to our Country. Senate Republicans will hopefully come through for all of us. The Tax Cut Bill is getting better and better. The end result will be great for ALL! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Nov 27, 2017 09:04:51 AM We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me). They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY! [Twitter for iPhone]

Nov 27, 2017 09:24:36 AM The Tax Cut Bill is coming along very well, great support.

Nov 29, 2017 05:54:56 PM This week, the Senate can join the House & take a strong stand for the Middle Class families who are the backbone of America.

Nov 29, 2017 08:03:30 PM The House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews [Twitter for iPhone] 
Nov 29, 2017 08:09:42 PM The only people who don’t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don’t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans! [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 1, 2017 06:03:35 AM The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. BUILD THE WALL! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 1, 2017 06:13:35 AM The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections. [Twitter for iPhone]

Rigged system, or just a double standard? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 2, 2017 09:13:28 PM Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails? No justice! [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 4, 2017 07:00:08 AM Putting Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Puppet Jones into office in Alabama would hurt our great Republican Agenda of low on taxes, tough on crime, strong on military and borders...& so much more.

Dec 8, 2017 10:06:55 AM LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military. VOTE ROY MOORE! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 8, 2017 10:18:27 AM Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased. I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating! [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 9, 2017 07:41:39 AM GREAT EVENING last night in Pensacola, Florida. Arena was packed to the rafters, the crowd was loud, loving and really smart. They definitely get what’s going on. Thank you Pensacola! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 9, 2017 07:52:18 AM A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night. We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat, Jones, in that important Alabama Senate seat. Need your vote to Make America Great Again! Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 9, 2017 08:02:23 AM Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 9, 2017 08:21:24 AM CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 9, 2017 10:45:47 AM Heading to the great state of Mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected Governor, @PhilBryantMS. Look forward to seeing the new Civil Rights Museum! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 9, 2017 01:19:31 PM It was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the Mississippi State History Museum & the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. We pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past & dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice & peace. https://t.co/5AkgVpV8aa [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 9, 2017 05:01:44 PM .@DaveWeigel @WashingtonPost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived @ the venue, w/ thousands of people outside, on their way in. Real photos now shown as I spoke. Packed house, many people unable to get in. Demand apology & retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo! https://t.co/XAblFGh1ob [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 9, 2017 06:14:34 PM .@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when, in fact, he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.). FAKE NEWS, he should be fired. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 9, 2017 06:39:15 PM Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY (last time was 1996). Wow! Congratulations! [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 9, 2017 09:17:25 PM No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans – not for criminal aliens! https://t.co/CvtkCG1pln [Media Studio] 
Dec 10, 2017 08:30:44 AM Things are going really well for our economy, a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH, unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news, and much more to come! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 10, 2017 08:35:28 AM Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill. Shaping up even better than projected. House and Senate working very hard and smart. End result will be not only important, but SPECIAL! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 10, 2017 04:18:40 PM Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed...a stain on America! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 11, 2017 09:17:18 AM Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong! Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News. I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the “dumbest man on television!” Bad Reporting. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 12, 2017 07:10:58 AM Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 12, 2017 08:03:35 AM Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 12, 2017 09:09:26 AM The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion, weak on Crime, Military and Illegal Immigration, Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 12, 2017 09:23:55 AM Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High, along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good). [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 12, 2017 11:08:41 PM Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory. The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 13, 2017 06:22:04 AM The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election. I was right! Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 13, 2017 08:02:52 AM Wow, more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media, the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 13, 2017 09:45:48 AM If last night’s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate. [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 14, 2017 03:13:04 PM Today, we gathered in the Roosevelt Room for one single reason: to CUT THE RED TAPE! For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regs, rules, and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, & devastated entire industries. https://t.co/ostXOVnckf [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 14, 2017 03:27:00 PM When Americans are free to thrive, innovate, & prosper, there is no challenge too great, no task too large, & no goal beyond our reach.

Dec 18, 2017 06:23:49 AM Remember, Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional Races this year. The media refuses to mention this.

Dec 18, 2017 01:41:05 PM The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly.

Dec 19, 2017 10:07:01 AM A story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to “rescinding” the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS.

Dec 20, 2017 01:09:06 AM The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. If approved, there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P.M. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 20, 2017 09:32:51 AM The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated Dems, and only demean. This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 20, 2017 11:39:04 AM I would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job both strategically & politically on the passing in the Senate of the MASSIVE TAX CUT & Reform Bill.

Dec 21, 2017 07:24:22 AM The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves.

Dec 22, 2017 07:47:51 AM Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses.

Dec 22, 2017 09:17:04 AM “The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year.” Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA.

Dec 23, 2017 03:27:05 PM How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?

Dec 23, 2017 05:44:45 PM The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 23, 2017 05:57:50 PM Remember, the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year. In Senate, I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost. Virginia candidate was not a “Trumper,” and he lost. Good Republican candidates will win BIG! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 24, 2017 07:25:22 AM .@FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.” [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 24, 2017 08:48:11 AM The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 24, 2017 03:35:26 PM The Tax Cut/Reform Bill, including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had.

Dec 26, 2017 06:58:42 AM Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare, the Democrats & Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 26, 2017 08:24:27 AM WOW, @foxandfrlends “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Dec 26, 2017 05:17:14 PM All signs are that business is looking really good for next year, only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill. Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS! Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS! [Twitter for iPhone]

Dec 29, 2017 07:46:23 AM While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28, 2017, was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28, 2009, which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage & Russia hoax!

Dec 29, 2017 08:16:11 AM The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!

Dec 29, 2017 10:42:58 PM Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption & its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad.

Jan 10, 2018 09:11:13 AM It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 10, 2018 10:00:29 AM The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 10, 2018 10:14:15 AM The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes.

Jan 11, 2018 10:01:20 PM Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 11, 2018 11:42:25 PM The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery & Chain. USA! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 11, 2018 11:57:57 PM Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 12, 2018 06:59:02 AM The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime..... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 12, 2018 07:09:58 AM ....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level.

Jan 12, 2018 07:20:32 AM ....Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 12, 2018 07:28:58 AM The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 12, 2018 07:50:00 AM Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 12, 2018 08:48:49 AM Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said “take them out.” Made up by Dems.

Jan 13, 2018 08:13:12 AM Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again! [Twitter for iPhone]

Jan 13, 2018 09:20:00 AM Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November, Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 13, 2018 09:20:01 AM I don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA. They are all talk and no action. This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have. Too bad! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 13, 2018 05:08:34 PM So much Fake News is being reported. They don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong. They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information. The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 14, 2018 07:58:43 AM The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N. Korea). Obviously I didn’t say that.

Jan 14, 2018 08:09:09 AM DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military. [Twitter for iPhone]

Jan 16, 2018 09:07:38 AM The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 16, 2018 09:19:46 AM Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative.

Jan 18, 2018 06:15:25 AM The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water..... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 18, 2018 06:25:03 AM ....The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!

Jan 19, 2018 05:17:53 PM Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan. Making progress - four week extension would be best! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 19, 2018 09:28:56 PM Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 06:17:10 AM Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 06:33:35 AM This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 06:44:01 AM For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 06:47:42 AM #AMERICA FIRST! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 09:27:54 AM Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 01:51:24 PM Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 05:31:27 PM Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election. Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, & ISIS, Judicial Strength & Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 07:47:40 PM The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation, in just twelve months, than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office, no matter what the length. The good news is, THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 20, 2018 09:18:51 PM Eric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 21, 2018 07:35:28 AM Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.’s! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 21, 2018 08:21:42 PM Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an “A”-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 22, 2018 08:07:09 AM The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 22, 2018 08:15:55 AM Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don’t want to do it but are powerless! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 22, 2018 10:13:18 AM End the Democrats Obstruction! https://t.co/tzBXilvW1b [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 22, 2018 11:30:33 PM Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 23, 2018 06:31:40 AM Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: “Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.” Thank you for your honesty Jim! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 23, 2018 06:51:04 AM In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI says it is now missing five months worth of lovers Strzok - Page texts, perhaps 50,000, all in prime time. Wow! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 23, 2018 06:55:42 AM In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 23, 2018 08:34:37 AM Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 23, 2018 09:16:02 AM Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 23, 2018 10:54:22 PM Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 23, 2018 11:07:27 PM Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 24, 2018 06:58:58 AM Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 24, 2018 03:26:16 PM Earlier today, I spoke with @GovMattBevin of Kentucky regarding yesterday’s shooting at Marshall County High School. My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt, Preston Cope, their families, and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery. We are with you! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 24, 2018 05:51:20 PM It was my great honor to welcome Mayor’s from across America to the WH. My Administration will always support local government - and listen to the leaders who know their communities best. Together, we will usher in a bold new era of Peace and Prosperity! https://t.co/dmYECTnk0a https://t.co/RSv7V7r0DT [Media Studio] 
Jan 24, 2018 07:27:00 PM Will soon be heading to Davos, Switzerland, to tell the world how great America is and is doing. Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing, will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 25, 2018 12:25:53 PM Great bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom, affirming the special relationship and our commitment to work together on key national security challenges and economic opportunities. #WEF18 https://t.co/FPP8aRDAyt [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 25, 2018 01:03:29 PM Very productive bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin @Netanyahu of Israel - in Davos, Switzerland! #WEF18 https://t.co/2sZM9YI7tJ [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 25, 2018 05:38:21 PM Today, Americans everywhere remember the brave men and women of @NASA who lost their lives in our Nation’s eternal quest to expand the boundaries of human potential. https://t.co/clBsJTGz8B https://t.co/jTJkusdBQA [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 26, 2018 05:11:26 AM Will be interviewed on @SquawkCNBC by @JoeSquawk coming up at 6:00amE from Davos, Switzerland. Enjoy! #WEF18 https://t.co/7egYlxnFBd [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 26, 2018 05:46:48 AM It was an honor to meet with Republic of Rwanda President Paul Kagame this morning in Davos, Switzerland. Many great discussions! #WEF18 https://t.co/SaPzwVhDiB [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 26, 2018 06:23:07 AM Great bilateral meeting with President @Alain_Berset of the Swiss Confederation - as we continue to strengthen our great friendship. Such an honor to be in Switzerland! #WEF18 https://t.co/87pLrCpQkZ [Twitter for iPhone]
Jan 26, 2018 07:54:36 AM Join me live at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland! #WEF18 https://t.co/fdHejCmv73 https://t.co/DuKJlVTWB8 [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 26, 2018 12:12:32 PM Heading back from a very exciting two days in Davos, Switzerland. Speech on America’s economic revival was well received. Many of the people I met will be investing in the U.S.A.! #MAGA [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 26, 2018 12:16:44 PM DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin’ Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 26, 2018 06:27:23 PM Thank you for the wonderful welcome @WEF! #Davos2018 https://t.co/IQkoQJxR5B [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 27, 2018 06:55:58 AM Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of “catch & release” and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety & Security reasons. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 27, 2018 02:30:24 PM On Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish men, women and children, and the millions of others who perished in the evil Nazi Genocide. We pledge with all of our might and resolve: Never Again! https://t.co/PfHM7UiZ0C https://t.co/25W0SZHTOu [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 27, 2018 05:59:52 PM Taliban targeted innocent Afghans, brave police in Kabul today. Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, and first responders. We will not allow the Taliban to win! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 27, 2018 10:58:02 PM I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 27, 2018 11:08:02 PM Democrats are not interested in Border Safety & Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 28, 2018 08:18:32 AM Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 28, 2018 08:18:33 AM Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 29, 2018 03:12:39 PM Congratulations to America’s new Secretary of @HHSGov, Alex Azar! https://t.co/Y9inQaCt7o [Twitter for iPhone] 
Jan 30, 2018 09:00:02 PM Join me live for the #SOTU https://t.co/0SLktWxfHi [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 1, 2018 06:43:17 AM Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party. Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA, not easy when we have no support from the Democrats. NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in ‘18. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 1, 2018 06:51:43 AM March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 1, 2018 07:02:49 AM Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in. Delivered from the heart! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 1, 2018 10:32:48 PM The Democrats just aren’t calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or they’ll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 2, 2018 06:33:58 AM The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 2, 2018 06:49:14 AM “You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the Trump Team.” Tom Fitton, JW [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 2, 2018 01:05:49 PM With 3.5 million Americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS, 2018 is off to great start! ✅Unemployment rate at 4.1%. ✅Average earnings up 2.9% in the last year. ✅200,000 new American jobs. ✅#MAGA🇺🇸 https://t.co/upqSvBhRqJ [Twitter for iPad] 
Feb 2, 2018 01:07:08 PM “Trump the orator outlines the greatness of America to Democrats’ disgust” https://t.co/XpirrtTY6V [Twitter for iPad] 
Feb 2, 2018 05:26:22 PM Today, it was my honor to join the great men and women of @DHSgov, @CustomsBorder, @ICEgov and @USCIS at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center in Sterling, Virginia. Fact sheet: https://t.co/Q027Wgdzdo https://t.co/NecuA0y1Sk [Twitter for iPad] 
Feb 3, 2018 09:40:23 AM Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain “sacred cows.” Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well, someday! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 3, 2018 09:40:27 AM This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 3, 2018 07:26:23 PM Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 3, 2018 07:40:24 PM “The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became.... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 3, 2018 07:53:18 PM ...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn’t straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.” Wall Street Journal [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 4, 2018 11:58:14 AM My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they’ve done! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 4, 2018 10:54:42 PM Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 5, 2018 07:11:56 AM The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 5, 2018 07:17:57 AM Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 5, 2018 07:39:10 AM Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 5, 2018 09:36:40 AM Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 5, 2018 10:08:51 AM Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 5, 2018 03:42:01 PM Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, your paychecks are going way UP, your taxes are going way DOWN, and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS! https://t.co/GISFbDDGXX [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 6, 2018 08:32:57 AM So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 6, 2018 08:37:00 AM My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 6, 2018 11:00:43 AM Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery. If D’s oppose this deal, they aren’t serious about DACA-they just want open borders. https://t.co/XDMcDOr9vM [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 6, 2018 11:05:42 AM We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system. Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security. https://t.co/rP9Gtr2E5N [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 6, 2018 05:45:50 PM Today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13, and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it. Watch here: https://t.co/VPMTnko7Ik https://t.co/4OaXXuj9Va [Media Studio] 
Feb 6, 2018 07:48:01 PM HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan! https://t.co/JtEglBhm4c [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 7, 2018 09:59:49 AM In the “old days,” when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up. Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 7, 2018 11:10:00 AM NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS! [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 7, 2018 05:13:16 PM Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics! What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration! https://t.co/giN2B1h6Ph [Media Studio] 
Feb 7, 2018 05:36:15 PM The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 8, 2018 06:08:39 AM Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including T.V. producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph, will be there. Looking forward to seeing all! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 8, 2018 12:13:13 PM Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares “IN GOD WE TRUST.” And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are “One Nation Under God.” #NationalPrayerBreakfast https://t.co/zukP40Ezpo [Twitter for iPad] 
Feb 8, 2018 01:44:00 PM I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm. Will be discussing North Korea, China and the Middle East. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 8, 2018 03:10:58 PM As long as we open our eyes to God’s grace - and open our hearts to God’s love - then America will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations. #NationalPrayerBreakfast https://t.co/1cwxs3l0uK [Twitter for iPad] 
Feb 8, 2018 06:26:22 PM Time to end the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/yukxm48x9X [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 8, 2018 10:22:53 PM Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 9, 2018 08:39:15 AM Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 9, 2018 08:47:28 AM Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military. Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 9, 2018 08:59:13 AM Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 09:02:54 AM Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 09:20:35 AM The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 10:20:05 AM According to the @nytimes, a Russian sold phony secrets on “Trump” to the U.S. Asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time. I hope people are now seeing & understanding what is going on here. It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 10:33:35 AM Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 01:16:20 PM “My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he’s been victimized. He’s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of....... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 01:34:49 PM ....agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don’t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 01:50:02 PM Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 04:18:23 PM My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @WestervillePD. https://t.co/AoingY77Ky [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 10, 2018 06:34:08 PM My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans. https://t.co/xV1lgfhjBU [Media Studio] 
Feb 11, 2018 01:21:48 PM So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn’t want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history! #MAGA [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 11, 2018 02:15:32 PM 4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 11, 2018 03:26:03 PM Rep. Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator. He is strong & smart, loves Pennsylvania & loves our Country! Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 11, 2018 03:36:08 PM Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD. This is a true tragedy! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 12, 2018 07:46:56 AM This will be a big week for Infrastructure. After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 12, 2018 07:54:32 AM Thank you to Sue Kruczek, who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge, for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 12, 2018 03:48:16 PM The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year. See you at #CPAC2018! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 13, 2018 05:43:22 AM Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 13, 2018 05:52:47 AM Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal. Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle. This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity! March 5th. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 14, 2018 01:15:12 PM As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all. Proclamation: https://t.co/Sw1iGIJgWV https://t.co/Nx0AEKZy5p [Media Studio] 
Feb 14, 2018 02:11:32 PM Today, I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate, as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America’s depleted infrastructure. https://t.co/8ByoQJsjTT https://t.co/BVBRDvHfcC [Twitter for iPad] 
Feb 14, 2018 03:50:11 PM My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 14, 2018 03:55:01 PM Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 15, 2018 07:12:41 AM So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 15, 2018 09:57:21 AM While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 15, 2018 12:33:41 PM In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need. https://t.co/bu140nscez https://t.co/OoTXMCSexB [Media Studio] 
Feb 15, 2018 02:25:23 PM The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @DHSgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in America.” It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn’t build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa... [Twitter for iPad] 
Feb 15, 2018 02:26:09 PM ...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants. Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders. If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley bill! [Twitter for iPad]

Feb 16, 2018 09:37:56 AM I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 16, 2018 09:49:54 AM Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 16, 2018 03:18:11 PM Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion! [Twitter for iPhone]
Feb 16, 2018 11:53:13 PM Our entire Nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims & their families in Parkland, FL. To teachers, law enforcement, first responders & medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage! https://t.co/3yJsrebZMG https://t.co/ti791dENTy [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 02:04:43 PM Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida. Will never forget them, or the evening! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 02:26:13 PM “Charges Deal Don A Big Win,” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results.” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. “She lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.” [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 02:36:14 PM Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 02:46:48 PM Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 03:11:32 PM The Fake News Media never fails. Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman! https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 03:16:39 PM “I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.” Rob Goldman Vice President of Facebook Ads https://t.co/A5ft7cGJkE [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 06:45:28 PM Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 11:08:45 PM Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 17, 2018 11:22:48 PM General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 07:02:52 AM Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 07:22:29 AM Finally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 07:33:16 AM I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 07:43:48 AM Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 08:11:28 AM If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 08:46:39 AM The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN. https://t.co/rYsv90cnvs [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 08:55:55 AM Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans, the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 18, 2018 12:10:32 PM Thank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 18, 2018 11:28:40 PM Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 19, 2018 08:42:10 AM Have a great, but very reflective, President’s Day! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 19, 2018 02:55:49 PM Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 19, 2018 09:21:08 PM .@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah. He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement! [Twitter for iPhone]
Feb 19, 2018 09:29:29 PM The U.S. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations & Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 19, 2018 09:48:02 PM “The Faith of Donald Trump,” a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb, is a very interesting read. Enjoy! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 07:24:54 AM Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 07:37:20 AM “There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” ..... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 07:46:18 AM ....The President Obama quote just before election. That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 07:54:39 AM Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R’s want to fix! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 08:03:53 AM Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You’ve come a long way Matt! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 08:11:58 AM Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 08:38:49 AM I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 10:16:06 AM A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security...... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 10:29:07 AM ....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn’t fit the Mainstream Media narrative. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 12:49:07 PM Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law. "This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses." https://t.co/w9aw68UwOj [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 08:08:00 PM Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 08:14:19 PM So true, thank you! https://t.co/9TTXlfokYz [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 20, 2018 08:18:36 PM @CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 21, 2018 09:03:32 AM Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Session! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 21, 2018 09:22:07 AM The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man. [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 21, 2018 01:20:25 PM Yesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the Medal of Valor. #AmericanHeroes https://t.co/em0wBbvy5P [Media Studio] 
Feb 21, 2018 04:12:45 PM .@FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham.

Feb 21, 2018 08:40:33 PM I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students, teachers and families. So much love in the midst of so much pain. We must not let them down.

Feb 22, 2018 07:26:28 AM I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 22, 2018 07:40:08 AM ....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 22, 2018 07:54:09 AM ....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 22, 2018 08:05:18 AM ....If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 22, 2018 08:13:32 AM I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 22, 2018 09:31:35 AM What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 22, 2018 09:53:52 AM Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A.M. to discuss School Safety. Next week it will be with our Nation’s Governors. It’s been many years of all talk, no action. We’ll get it done! [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 22, 2018 03:07:20 PM Today, it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials. There is nothing more important than protecting our children. They deserve to be safe, and we will deliver! https://t.co/WhC2AxgWXO [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 22, 2018 08:26:26 PM “School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question.” @TuckerCarlson. Just like so much of CNN, Fake News. That’s why their ratings are so bad! MSNBC may be worse. [Twitter for iPhone]
Feb 23, 2018 06:28:35 AM MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from El Salvador, and through Mexico, like water.

Feb 24, 2018 01:54:14 PM Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept & have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 24, 2018 03:16:32 PM Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania. @FoxNews. This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole. Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 24, 2018 04:07:43 PM Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973. Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 24, 2018 04:18:01 PM Dems are no longer talking DACA! “Out of sight, out of mind,” they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn’t care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 24, 2018 05:26:15 PM BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you!). 50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny!). 79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen).

Feb 24, 2018 06:16:13 PM The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL! [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 24, 2018 06:44:11 PM “Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump” @FoxNews Of course not, because there is none, and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia! [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 27, 2018 06:59:30 AM “He’s got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton’s criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated. I fully agree with the President on that.” @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 27, 2018 07:28:59 AM “I’ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don’t see the evidence....in terms of the collusion, it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.” Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 27, 2018 07:45:58 AM “We’ve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don’t see it.” Judge Ken Starr [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 27, 2018 05:55:36 PM Texas LC George P. Bush backed me when it wasn’t the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.

Feb 27, 2018 05:58:19 PM .@SenatorWicker of Mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive Tax Cut Bill done and approved. Also big help on cutting regs. I am with him in his re-election all the way! [Twitter for iPhone]

Feb 27, 2018 11:28:31 PM Big legal win today. U.S. judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border. Now this important project can go forward! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 28, 2018 07:02:58 AM The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done, faster than even Ronald Reagan. “We’re blown away,” said Thomas Binion of Heritage, President Trump “is very active, very conservative and very effective. Huge volume & spectrum of issues.” [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 28, 2018 07:29:56 AM I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved. Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed. OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 28, 2018 09:08:21 AM 45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country. MS-13 thugs being hit hard. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 28, 2018 09:34:37 AM Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 28, 2018 12:10:22 PM Today, in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham – an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God’s grace. https://t.co/5aMh8nFPJW [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 28, 2018 01:36:53 PM Starting at a small Bible School in Florida, Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival.

Feb 28, 2018 02:01:34 PM Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored.

Feb 28, 2018 04:34:16 PM It was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of Congress for a discussion on SAFE schools and SAFE communities.

Mar 1, 2018 06:53:58 AM Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House. Background Checks a big part of conversation. Gun free zones are proven targets of killers. After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 1, 2018 07:12:42 AM Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 2, 2018 05:42:42 AM Alex Baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing DJT was agony for him. Alex, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You were terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 2, 2018 05:50:34 AM When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 2, 2018 06:07:40 AM Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent! [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 2, 2018 08:57:22 AM When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice! [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 3, 2018 12:33:53 PM Mainstream Media in U.S. is being mocked all over the world. They’ve gone CRAZY! https://t.co/4UGYuJpUA7 [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 3, 2018 12:43:26 PM The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 3, 2018 12:53:50 PM If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 4, 2018 12:42:03 PM The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 4, 2018 07:10:12 PM We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it’s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 5, 2018 06:47:56 AM We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must.. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 5, 2018 06:53:48 AM ...treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying. [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 5, 2018 08:22:29 AM Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November?

Mar 5, 2018 03:37:51 PM It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months, they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 6, 2018 07:55:35 AM The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision.

Mar 10, 2018 12:23:16 PM Spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who is very enthusiastic about talks with North Korea.

Mar 10, 2018 01:38:17 PM North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. I believe they will honor that commitment! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 10, 2018 03:02:02 PM In the first hours after hearing that North Korea’s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled & amazed.They couldn’t believe it. But by the following morning the news became FAKE.They said so what, who cares! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 10, 2018 04:29:37 PM The European Union, wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade, are complaining about the tariffs on Steel & Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on U.S. products going in, we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not, we Tax Cars etc. FAIR! [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 11, 2018 08:41:04 AM The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out.

Mar 11, 2018 08:50:47 AM ...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary.

Mar 11, 2018 09:02:23 AM The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners.

Mar 11, 2018 09:49:29 AM The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...A record in U.S. history. State Department, Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. Senate must approve NOW! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 11, 2018 10:16:22 AM Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than Obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are “somewhat low.” They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 12, 2018 07:20:03 AM Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers. [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 12, 2018 09:43:36 AM The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress. He will be much better for steel and business. Very strong on experience and what our Country needs.

Mar 13, 2018 10:27:18 AM California’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 13, 2018 05:23:26 PM If we don’t have a wall system, we’re not going to have a country. Congress must fund the BORDER WALL & prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country & the people of our country.

Mar 17, 2018 12:11:50 PM As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 17, 2018 12:34:21 PM The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 17, 2018 07:12:48 PM The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 18, 2018 07:02:31 AM Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” He said strongly “never, no.” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 18, 2018 07:22:11 AM Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 18, 2018 07:35:42 AM Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION! [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 21, 2018 01:56:14 PM I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing....... [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 21, 2018 10:00:36 PM Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming. Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year...most ever. Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 21, 2018 10:04:47 PM Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care. I had to fight for Military and start of Wall. [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 22, 2018 05:40:37 AM Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well, not saying that anymore! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 22, 2018 01:40:54 PM As a candidate, I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect American workers, and defend our national security.

Mar 23, 2018 06:01:10 PM As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill. I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again.

Mar 25, 2018 05:33:25 AM Because of the $700 & $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military, many jobs are created and our Military is again rich.

Mar 25, 2018 05:42:20 AM Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)! [Twitter for iPhone]

Mar 29, 2018 06:57:38 AM I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election.

The Failing N.Y. Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Mar 31, 2018 07:52:59 AM ...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so REGISTER.

Apr 1, 2018 08:56:34 AM Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 1, 2018 09:25:46 AM Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 1, 2018 09:28:19 AM These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 2, 2018 06:02:30 AM Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws..... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 2, 2018 06:10:19 AM ...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 2, 2018 06:17:19 AM DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 2, 2018 08:08:47 AM Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 2, 2018 08:28:42 AM So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 2, 2018 08:35:03 AM Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 2, 2018 07:12:03 PM Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES.

Apr 3, 2018 05:49:07 AM The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there.

Apr 9, 2018 05:03:16 AM When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!

Apr 10, 2018 08:30:35 AM Last night, it was my great honor to host America’s senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House. America’s military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world. They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform! https://t.co/BjWKcMX0iL [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 11, 2018 05:30:19 AM The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia C story! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 11, 2018 05:38:42 AM So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House. Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have Bolton & Larry K on board. I (we) are [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 11, 2018 05:47:37 AM ....doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 11, 2018 05:57:30 AM Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 11, 2018 06:37:56 AM Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 11, 2018 08:00:23 AM Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 11, 2018 08:50:23 AM Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 12, 2018 11:46:15 AM I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons!).

Apr 12, 2018 12:13:12 PM Just had an Agricultural Roundtable with memembers of Congress and Governors.

Apr 12, 2018 10:15:16 PM Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres. Obama.

Apr 13, 2018 06:44:51 AM Tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 13, 2018 07:01:47 AM James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and..... [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 13, 2018 07:17:37 AM ....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 13, 2018 02:36:27 PM DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 14, 2018 07:21:00 AM A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 14, 2018 07:29:48 AM So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won’t be anything, or anyone, even close! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 06:42:33 AM Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 06:57:14 AM The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 07:08:03 AM Comey throws AG Lynch “under the bus!” Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 07:19:42 AM The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term “Mission Accomplished.” I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 07:32:16 AM I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 07:56:13 AM Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 08:07:10 AM Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 15, 2018 09:44:30 AM Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News, it’s hard to believe! Thank you America, we are doing Great Things. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 16, 2018 07:25:19 AM Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 16, 2018 07:31:02 AM Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 17, 2018 07:24:36 AM Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 17, 2018 12:59:39 PM Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day.

Apr 17, 2018 09:49:28 PM While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don’t like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 18, 2018 04:59:07 AM There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept.

Apr 18, 2018 07:05:42 AM Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 19, 2018 10:23:22 AM Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all Americans at risk. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 19, 2018 10:48:38 AM Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 National Guard Troops” to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough, and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown’s charade. We need border security and action, not words! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 19, 2018 03:21:16 PM Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government, hence, the American People.

Apr 19, 2018 03:27:01 PM ...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors, Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 19, 2018 03:31:56 PM Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 19, 2018 05:30:25 PM My thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 19, 2018 05:30:36 PM Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in America difficult! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 19, 2018 05:46:06 PM James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe “under the bus.” Inspector General’s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 19, 2018 10:37:26 PM James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 20, 2018 05:34:16 AM So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 20, 2018 05:57:12 AM Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 20, 2018 03:25:13 PM Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers, including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 20, 2018 05:34:26 PM Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 20, 2018 05:50:34 PM North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 20, 2018 06:19:51 PM Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats.

[Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 20, 2018 10:13:07 PM James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 20, 2018 10:22:51 PM A message from Kim Jong Un: “North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.” Also will “Shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.” Progress being made for all!

Apr 21, 2018 02:24:21 PM James Comey’s Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 21, 2018 03:13:08 PM The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as “Mr. Magoo” and Rod Rosenstein as “Mr. Peepers.” This is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” There are no such people and don’t know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 21, 2018 05:30:45 PM “At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.” Wall Street Journal [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 22, 2018 07:50:22 AM Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we haven’t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, & no more testing! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 22, 2018 08:02:01 AM ....We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won’t - only time will tell....But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 22, 2018 03:04:10 PM Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, “you got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There’s no there there.” Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 23, 2018 08:15:19 AM Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before. Need more Republicans! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 23, 2018 08:44:46 AM Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 23, 2018 08:51:17 AM Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast. [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 26, 2018 06:39:32 PM The U.S. has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup. It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)? [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 27, 2018 05:26:35 AM Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can’t define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He’s either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!

Apr 27, 2018 06:50:02 AM Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea. Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 27, 2018 08:19:53 PM House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia.

Apr 28, 2018 07:07:16 AM Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false.

Apr 28, 2018 02:11:51 PM Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester’s statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with, just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 29, 2018 06:45:40 AM While Washington, Michigan, was a big success, Washington, D.C., just didn’t work. Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big, boring bust...the so-called comedian really “bombed.” @greggutfeld should host next year! @PeteHegseth [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 29, 2018 09:38:00 PM The White House Correspondents’ Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy “comedian” totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest, or start over! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 29, 2018 09:59:23 PM Headline: “Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade” - from the Failing New York Times. Also, will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 30, 2018 07:10:58 AM The White House Correspondents’ Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Apr 30, 2018 07:19:33 AM Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking! [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 30, 2018 05:38:35 PM The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First. [Twitter for iPhone]

Apr 30, 2018 05:49:55 PM The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist).

Apr 30, 2018 06:02:13 PM The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going “bonkers!” [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 1, 2018 05:47:30 AM So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 1, 2018 06:00:00 AM Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country.

May 7, 2018 06:04:47 AM My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists.

May 7, 2018 06:27:34 AM The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia.

This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America’s bright and glorious future! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 8, 2018 06:22:53 AM I will be speaking to my friend, President Xi of China, this morning at 8:30. The primary topics will be Trade, where good things will happen, and North Korea, where relationships and trust are building. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 8, 2018 06:30:23 AM John Kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it! Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 8, 2018 01:52:00 PM Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal: https://t.co/O3SpryCKkc [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 8, 2018 05:11:13 PM The Iran Deal is defective at its core. If we do nothing, we know what will happen. In just a short time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons.... https://t.co/58qwBLzxIH [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 06:24:20 AM The Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong, and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes, why wouldn’t we win? [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 06:38:45 AM The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials? [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 06:48:17 AM Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart “thinkers,” and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 07:00:30 AM Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs. His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 07:30:56 AM I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date & Place set. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 07:35:51 AM Secretary Pompeo and his “guests” will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 05:38:10 PM The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing), when in fact he was flying to North Korea. Fake News, so bad! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 05:41:03 PM Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 9, 2018 09:19:02 PM Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today. There is nobody even close to run the CIA! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 10, 2018 09:30:27 AM Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 11, 2018 02:30:16 PM Today, my Administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American People. We will have tougher negotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter! https://t.co/xdakX43a4d [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 11, 2018 03:56:25 PM The American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them. We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality, affordable medication they need and deserve. We will not rest until the job is done! https://t.co/9BzevAniNx [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 11, 2018 06:39:01 PM Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem. Congratulations to all! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 11, 2018 06:49:40 PM Why doesn’t the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration’s Anti-Trust Division has been, and is, opposed to the AT&T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial. Such a disgrace in reporting! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 12, 2018 04:08:55 PM North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 12, 2018 05:02:55 PM Iran’s Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 12, 2018 05:20:16 PM The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 13, 2018 10:01:00 AM President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 13, 2018 02:22:03 PM China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool, it will all work out! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 13, 2018 03:11:33 PM Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now, that will not happen! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 13, 2018 07:03:21 PM So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on. This kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, & successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 14, 2018 05:54:15 AM U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on @FoxNews & @FoxBusiness. Lead up to 9:00 A.M. (eastern) event has already begun. A great day for Israel! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 14, 2018 03:06:53 PM ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 14, 2018 03:46:25 PM The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 14, 2018 04:09:16 PM Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania. Successful procedure, she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 15, 2018 07:26:59 AM Our great First Lady is doing really well. Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. Thank you for so much love and support! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 15, 2018 07:35:30 AM Trade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S., for many years. Stay tuned! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 15, 2018 09:08:21 AM Can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 16, 2018 07:25:42 AM Congratulations to Deb Fischer. The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! #MAGA [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 16, 2018 08:09:19 AM The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China. Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China... [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 16, 2018 08:09:20 AM ...We have not seen China’s demands yet, which should be few in that previous U.S. Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. China has seen our demands. There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings... [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 16, 2018 08:09:20 AM ...haven’t even started yet! The U.S. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. China has much to give! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 16, 2018 01:40:35 PM Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent, Bob Casey, has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time. He votes along the Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare... [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 16, 2018 01:40:36 PM ...and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill. He’s also weak on borders and crime. Sadly, our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr. Lou Barletta will win! #MAGA [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 16, 2018 05:57:25 PM Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA. She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately. We need her to keep our great country safe! #ConfirmGina [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 17, 2018 06:28:09 AM Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 17, 2018 06:56:15 AM Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI “SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT.” Andrew McCarthy says, “There’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” If so, this is bigger than Watergate! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 17, 2018 08:52:44 AM Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and “Haters,” but that’s the way it is! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 17, 2018 10:25:57 AM Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE – Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 18, 2018 05:24:53 AM “Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn’t commit.” David Asman @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Really bad stuff! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 18, 2018 05:51:43 AM Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, “Animals.” Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as “Animals,” a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 18, 2018 08:38:11 AM Why isn’t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe’s wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 18, 2018 08:50:11 AM Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a “hot” Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 18, 2018 03:41:21 PM Just met with UN Secretary-General António Guterres who is working hard to “Make the United Nations Great Again.” When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money. @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job! https://t.co/pqUv6cyH2z [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 18, 2018 05:00:58 PM California finally deserves a great Governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - he’ll be the best Governor you’ve ever had.

May 19, 2018 04:27:48 PM If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 08:04:21 AM Things are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 08:11:05 AM ....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption... [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 08:19:34 AM ...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 08:29:32 AM Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 08:37:34 AM What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server? [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 09:04:24 AM ....and why hasn’t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.? [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 12:13:47 PM The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the World. Oh’ great! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 20, 2018 12:37:40 PM I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 21, 2018 06:21:29 AM I ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didn’t President Obama & the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING! With that being said, Chuck & I have long agreed on this issue! Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 22, 2018 08:13:46 PM If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal... [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 22, 2018 08:13:46 PM ...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 23, 2018 05:45:37 AM @foxandfriends “New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?” Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 23, 2018 05:54:01 AM Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State.

May 23, 2018 02:35:18 PM Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as Catch-and-Release. Democrats must abandon their resistance... https://t.co/VkMCIzwt8v [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 23, 2018 06:41:47 PM Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage, New York. Keep up the great work! https://t.co/SMaZ8Hfas4 [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 23, 2018 07:08:49 PM Great to be in New York for the day. Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now, lots of work to be done! https://t.co/w3LUiQ8SWh [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 23, 2018 07:58:04 PM Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 A.M. Enjoy! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 24, 2018 07:21:08 AM Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 24, 2018 07:34:29 AM Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 24, 2018 10:03:23 AM Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jung Un. https://t.co/qEoi9ymUEz [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 24, 2018 11:18:25 AM Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un. https://t.co/rLwXxBxFKx [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 24, 2018 11:24:38 AM It was my great honor to host a roundtable re: MS-13 yesterday in Bethpage, New York. Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives! https://t.co/pxe9Z4efyZ [Media Studio] 
May 24, 2018 11:57:51 AM I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th. While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world... https://t.co/jT0GfxT0Lc [Media Studio] 
May 24, 2018 12:54:36 PM Today, it was my honor to sign #S2155, the "Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.” Read more: https://t.co/sYZ4PzzxxW https://t.co/gi0qGe6ukX [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 24, 2018 04:18:32 PM Today, it was my great honor to present the #MedalOfHonor to @USNavy (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse. Full ceremony: https://t.co/2UldFozRh1 https://t.co/R3ACmkWsqJ [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 06:50:37 AM I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 07:04:16 AM The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an “Informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the Russian Hoax? [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 07:04:17 AM Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 07:04:19 AM “Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.” Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 07:04:20 AM Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 07:14:07 AM Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell! [Twitter for iPhone]
May 25, 2018 12:12:13 PM Today, it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States @NavalAcademy in Annapolis, Maryland. Congratulations! Good luck. Godspeed. And ANCHORS AWEIGH! https://t.co/aoLBK7y16a [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 12:22:37 PM On behalf of the American People, CONGRATULATIONS! We love you! https://t.co/YRlj0vRXwk [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 03:39:26 PM To the @NavalAcademy Class of 2018, I say: We know you are up to the task. We know you will make us proud. We know that glory will be yours. Because you are WINNERS, you are WARRIORS, you are FIGHTERS, you are CHAMPIONS, and YOU will lead us to VICTORY! God Bless the U.S.A.! https://t.co/V9TgEo8MY4 [Media Studio] 
May 25, 2018 05:14:54 PM Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job. The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 05:45:32 PM Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under “O” [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 06:07:19 PM Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing.... [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 06:13:19 PM ...but complain and obstruct. They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 25, 2018 07:37:35 PM We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 08:22:09 AM Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 08:59:02 AM Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 09:38:54 AM Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House. The great people of Utah are Celebrating! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 09:47:14 AM Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world! [Twitter for iPhone]
May 26, 2018 10:03:33 AM Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe, there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to how to deal with North Korea...and if there was, it wouldn’t matter. The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 10:21:10 AM The Failing @nytimes quotes “a senior White House official,” who doesn’t exist, as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.” WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 02:28:04 PM With Spies, or “Informants” as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem? [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 02:41:50 PM This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven’t been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 02:56:52 PM When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It’s been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia? [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 26, 2018 08:49:54 PM WELCOME HOME JOSH! https://t.co/2X0cKE4stx [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 27, 2018 07:41:24 AM Who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 27, 2018 08:14:04 AM Fantastic to have 400,000 GREAT MEN & WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D.C. showing their patriotism. They love our Country, they love our Flag, they stand for our National Anthem! Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 27, 2018 09:13:24 AM Why didn’t the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia? Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation! [Twitter for iPhone]
May 27, 2018 03:09:12 PM Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen! [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 27, 2018 03:32:33 PM Why didn’t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing. [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 28, 2018 06:01:47 AM #MemorialDay🇺🇸 https://t.co/Iohcuhi4dQ [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 28, 2018 07:58:07 AM Happy Memorial Day! Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. Best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years), rebuilding our Military and so much more. Nice! [Twitter for iPhone]

May 28, 2018 09:08:56 AM “Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept. I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable.” Jonathan Turley [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 28, 2018 09:32:31 AM “We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation. That raises legitimate questions. I just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.” Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 28, 2018 12:13:04 PM Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance. We are gathered here on the sacred soil of @ArlingtonNatl Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America's greatest heroes, the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom. #MemorialDay https://t.co/YSYAHf7bNu [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 28, 2018 12:14:45 PM The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields, in cemeteries, battlefields, and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life. They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies, from privilege and from poverty... https://t.co/aOw3QwN2SV [Twitter for iPhone] 
May 28, 2018 12:19:33 PM Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny. They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served. They cared for their families more than anything in the world, they loved their families. They inspired their communities... https://t.co/Q9cOcQeEDc [Twitter for iPhone]
